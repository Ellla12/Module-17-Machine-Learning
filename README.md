# Module 17: Machine-Learning

## Overview:

The purpose of the analysis is to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. For this challenge, we are tasked with the following:

- use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries build and evaluate models using resampling
- from the sampling, use the data to predict credit risk

## Results:



## Summary:
From the sampling we can conclude that, Naive Random Oversampling had the best balanced accuracy  score.
